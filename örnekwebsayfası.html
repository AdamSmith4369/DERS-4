        Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 –
        November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher,
        and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called
        Timely Publications which would later become Marvel Comics. He was the
        primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a
        small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that
        dominated the comics and film industries. In collaboration with others
        at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he
        co-created iconic characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the
        X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four,
        Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black
        Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered
        a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee
        challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly
        leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the
        development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.
        Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public
        figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo appearances in
        films and television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he
        received an executive producer credit. He continued independent creative
        ventures into his 90s until his death in 2018. Lee was inducted into the
        comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the
        Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of
        Arts in 2008.
